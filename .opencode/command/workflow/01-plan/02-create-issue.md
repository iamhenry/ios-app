# Create Issue Command

Creates detailed task templates using comprehensive templates designed for delegating work to junior developers. Creates local files in `_ai/task/`.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS

**BEFORE PROCEEDING - VERIFY:**

- [ ] ALL 15+ template sections included (no exceptions)
- [ ] Local file created in `_ai/task/` directory

## Usage

/create-issue [task-title] [task-description]

### Auto-Generation

- When no arguments provided: auto-generates title and description using natural language based on current context
- Uses git status, recent commits, and general project state for smart defaults

### My Manual Inputs

- adr.md (ex. `_ai/task/2025-11-26-m6-fuzzy-matching/adr.md`)

---

## Implementation

You are a task template creator that takes user input and creates comprehensive, well-structured templates as GitHub issues and/or local files.

### Input Processing

The task details are provided as: $ARGUMENTS

Parse the arguments to extract:

1. Task title (first argument or auto-generate if empty)
2. Task description and context (remaining arguments or auto-generate if empty)

### Auto-Generation Logic

When no title/description provided:

1. Analyze current context (git status, recent commits, branch name)
2. Generate a practical task title and description using natural language
3. Focus on immediate development needs and current work
4. Default to generic development task if context is minimal

---

### Task Template

Create tasks using this comprehensive template (used for both GitHub issues and local files):

````markdown
## [PARSED TASK TITLE]

<!--
- THIS IS YOUR SOURCE OF TRUTH.
- USE IT TO TAKE ANY NOTES YOU MAY FIND HELPFUL.
- AS YOU COMPLETE THE TASK, UPDATE THIS CHECKLIST TO REFLECT PROGRESS. (- [x] for done, - [ ] for pending)
-->

### Description

[Use the parsed task description and expand with clear, concise explanation of what needs to be done. Include the goal or purpose to give context.]

### Current vs Target State Comparison

| Scenario            | Current                                  | Target                              |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **User Experience** | [Current user behavior/pain points]      | [Desired user experience]           |
| **Code Structure**  | [Existing files/components/architecture] | [New/modified files/components]     |
| **Data Flow**       | [How data currently moves]               | [How data should move]              |
| **Performance**     | [Current performance characteristics]    | [Expected performance improvements] |
| **Dependencies**    | [Current dependencies/libraries]         | [New dependencies required]         |
| **Error Handling**  | [Current error states]                   | [Improved error handling]           |

### Acceptance Criteria

[Generate acceptance criteria that are **measurable** and **testable**. Each criterion must include verifiable conditions, not just desired states. Format as checkboxes.]

**MEASURABLE Format Examples:**
- ✅ `API endpoint returns 200 status code with valid response schema` (testable via automated test)
- ✅ `Button click triggers navigation to /dashboard within 100ms` (measurable latency)
- ❌ `User has a good experience` (subjective, not measurable)

**TESTABLE Requirements:**
Each AC must answer: "How would I verify this passes?" 
- Include expected outputs, states, or side effects
- Specify exact values, ranges, or conditions when possible
- Reference specific files, functions, or endpoints affected

### User Story

[Generate one high-impact user story in the format: "As a [user type], I want [functionality] so that [benefit/value]". Include 1-2 acceptance criteria following the measurable/testable format above, focusing on the most critical user-facing behaviors or outcomes.]

### Gherkin BDD Scenarios

[Generate primary (happy path) and secondary (edge case) scenarios in Given-When-Then format. Each scenario must include testable acceptance criteria with expected outputs/states:]

```md
### Scenario: [User action and outcome]

Given [user state/precondition]
When [user action]
Then [user-visible outcome with verifiable condition]

Acceptance Criteria:

- [Measurable outcome: specific value/threshold/state]
```
````

[Repeat this template for both primary and secondary scenarios with different contexts.]

### 🧩 Implementation Checklist (Step-by-Step To-Do)

#### Phase 1: Implementation Tasks

<!-- A detailed and thorough decomposed checklist (with tasks and subtasks) that's broken up into logical phases/milestones for a junior developer to accomplish this task. -->

**FORMAT GUIDE** (Use this structure for first phase, then repeat pattern for subsequent phases):

**Phase N: [Descriptive Phase Name] ([Time Estimate])**

**Task N.X: [Clear Task Objective]**

- [ ] ACTION: [Description of task] [specific file/location]
- [ ] ACTION: [Description] [what is being added/changed]
- [ ] ACTION: [Implementation step with technical detail]
  - [ ] SUBTASK: [Nested substep if needed]
- [ ] NOTE: [Reference similar patterns, file locations, line numbers if helpful]

**ACTION PREFIXES:**
Start every checklist item with an **ALL CAPS** Action Verb followed by a colon. This makes the step immediately actionable.

*Suggested prefixes (use these or similar specific verbs):*

- CREATE: / ADD: (New files/features)
- UPDATE: / MODIFY: (Existing code)
- IMPLEMENT: (Core logic)
- RESEARCH: / ANALYZE: (Investigation tasks)
- REFACTOR: (Cleanup)
- VERIFY: / TEST: (Validation steps)
- CONFIG: (Settings/Env)

**CODE SNIPPET GUIDELINES:**

- Include code snippets for complex implementations or non-obvious patterns
- Reference existing code: "Mirror pattern from `file.ts:line-number`" or copy small snippets
- Provide inline code examples for new functions, types, or configurations
- Use markdown code blocks with language syntax highlighting (e.g., `tsx, `ts, ```bash)
- Show before/after code for modifications to existing files
- Keep snippets concise and focused on the specific task

**STYLE RULES:**

- **Use Action Prefixes**: Ensure checklist items start with an ALL CAPS verb (e.g., CREATE:, RESEARCH:).
- Include file paths in backticks: `path/to/file.ts`
- Reference code patterns: "Clone X from `file.ts:20-65`" or "Mirror pattern in `file.ts`"
- Nest substeps when task has multiple parts (use 2-space indentation)
- Add "Implementation notes:" as last item to guide junior developers to examples
- Keep tasks atomic: one clear outcome per task

**REPEAT THIS STRUCTURE** for each subsequent phase/milestone.

**IMPORTANT NOTES:**

- Focus ONLY on code implementation - NO test creation unless explicitly requested
- Each task should specify the files to create/modify
- Break down into atomic tasks following the guidelines above

---

[Generate the actual implementation checklist following the format above]

#### Phase 2: Verification Gate

Once implementation is complete, verify the task outcome before attempting a commit. Choose the lightest verification target that can prove the core user flow works:

- [ ] **web / mobile-web**: Browser verification targets for desktop or responsive/mobile browser UI
- [ ] **ios / macos**: Apple app verification targets
- [ ] **non-ui**: Direct command, API, log, or test proof when UI automation is not the strongest signal

**NOTE**: This phase is SEPARATE from implementation and from commit. The goal is to prove the intended task behavior works end to end, not just to run code quality commands.

---

### Verification Target

<!-- Include when the task needs explicit post-implementation validation. State what to prove; verification-gate owns how to prove it. Pick the smallest target and evidence that can prove the task works. -->

Use the `verification-gate` skill to prove the task works before commit. `web` and `mobile-web` route to browser verification; `ios` and `macos` route to Apple app verification; `non-ui` routes to direct command, API, log, or test proof.

**Required fields:**
- **Platform**: `web | mobile-web | ios | macos | non-ui`
- **Objective**: The single main outcome that must be proven
- **Primary Flow**: 3-5 checkpoints covering the core happy-path flow
- **Regression Check**: 1 lightweight adjacent behavior check when relevant
- **Evidence Required**: `screenshot | recording | test output | logs`
- **Pass Criteria**: Exact condition that counts as success
- **Blocked Conditions**: Missing auth, data, environment, or tooling that would prevent reliable verification

**Evidence rules:**
- Use `screenshot` when a static state is enough to prove the outcome
- Use `recording` when the user journey requires interaction or async state changes; prefer one recording for the full sequence instead of multiple short clips
- Use `test output` or `logs` when direct command, API, or automated test proof is clearer than UI evidence
- Save browser artifacts to `_ai/task/{SLUG}/verification/videos/{step}.webm`
- Save browser artifacts to `_ai/task/{SLUG}/verification/screenshots/{step}.png`

**Example (`web`):**
1. Open `http://localhost:3000/create`
2. Decide the lightest proof: use `screenshot` if a static state is enough, or `recording` if the flow needs interaction proof
3. If using `recording`, record one full sequence: select model -> enter prompt -> submit -> wait for completion -> verify generated images render
4. If using `screenshot`, capture the one or two proof states that clearly show success

---

[Generate a verification target with 3-5 checkpoints for the primary flow and 0-1 regression checks. Use the lightest evidence required that proves success or failure. Prefer a single full-flow recording for interactive journeys and screenshots only for static proof states.]

#### Phase 3: Commit Changes

Once verification passes, commit the work using the repo's normal commit conventions.

- [ ] **Create Commit**: Attempt the commit after Phase 2 passes
- [ ] **Handle Hook Failures**: If commit hooks fail, inspect the output, fix the issues, and retry the commit

**NOTE**: Do not bypass commit hooks. Treat hook failures as feedback that must be resolved before the task is considered complete.

### Manual QA Checklist

<!-- Steps that require human action and cannot be automated by the agent. -->

[Checklist of manual steps the developer must perform — environment configuration, third-party dashboard settings, deploy verification, access control checks, etc.]

**Example:**
- [ ] Enable webhook endpoint in Stripe dashboard
- [ ] Verify CloudFlare DNS records propagated

```

## Atomic Task Requirements

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

**Each task must meet these criteria for optimal agent execution:**

- **File Scope**: Touches 1-4 related files maximum
- **Single Purpose**: One testable outcome per task
- **Specific Files**: Specify files to create/modify
- **Agent-Friendly**: Clear input/output with minimal context switching

## Task Format Guidelines

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

- Use checkbox format: `- [ ] Task number. Task description`
- **Use subtasks**: Group related work under parent tasks (e.g., 4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3)
- **Specify implementation details** as bullet points under each subtask
- **Avoid broad terms**: No "system", "integration", "complete" in task titles
- **DO NOT include test creation** in implementation tasks unless explicitly requested in the task description
- **Verification gate** should be listed in Phase 2 after implementation tasks; **commit + hook remediation** should be listed separately in Phase 3
- Distinguish between "writing code" and "running validation commands"

## Good vs Bad Task Examples

(for reference only, not to be included in the final document)

❌ **Bad Examples (Too Broad)**:

- "Implement authentication system" (affects too many files, multiple purposes)
- "Add user management features" (vague scope, no files specification)
- "Build complete dashboard" (too large, multiple components)

✅ **Good Examples (Atomic with Subtasks)**:

- 4. Develop API endpoints and routing
  - 4.1 Set up routing configuration and middleware
  - 4.2 IMPLEMENT: Add CRUD API endpoints
  - 4.3 UPDATE: Add API documentation
  - 4.4 RESEARCH: Compare library X vs Y for validation

---

### Local File Creation

When creating local files:

1. Generate slug from task title:
   - Extract 3-5 key words from parsed task title
   - Convert to lowercase, replace spaces/special chars with dashes
   - Remove articles (a, an, the) and filler words (for, with, using)
   - Example: "Implement Spotify Preflight Token Validation" → `spotify-preflight-validation`
2. Create timestamp using `date +%Y-%m-%d`
3. Create directory: `_ai/task/{TIMESTAMP}-{SLUG}/`
4. Write file as: `plan.md`
5. Full path: `_ai/task/{TIMESTAMP}-{SLUG}/plan.md`

Example: `_ai/task/2025-11-20-spotify-preflight-validation/plan.md`

---

### Error Handling

**For Local Files:**

- Check write permissions for `_ai/task/` directory
- Handle directory creation if it doesn't exist
- Provide clear feedback on file location

### Implementation Steps

1. **Parse Arguments**: Extract content, auto-generate if needed
2. **Generate Content**: Create comprehensive task template using parsed/generated data
3. **Create Local File**: Write to `_ai/task/{TIMESTAMP}-{SLUG}/plan.md`
4. **Report Results**: Provide clear feedback on file location

Start by processing $ARGUMENTS, auto-generating content if needed, and creating the local file.
