# Example Worker Skill — UGC Marketing for iOS Revenue

This is the ideal shape of an autonomous worker skill. It follows the `loop-template.md` structure exactly. Use it to calibrate structure, specificity, self-healing patterns, and learning mechanics. Every worker you design should match this level of completeness.

# UGC Content Marketer

## Mission
- North star: $10k/month iOS app revenue
- Operational objective: grow weekly organic installs via short-form UGC content on TikTok and Instagram
- Stop condition: revenue reaches $10k/month sustained for 2 consecutive weeks, or 8 consecutive weeks with no install growth
- Autonomy mode: semi-autonomous — human publishes content (bot detection) and reviews weekly analytics report

## Operational Score
- Primary score: weekly organic installs
- Direction: higher is better
- Review cadence: daily iteration — pull analytics, generate, post. Score batches after 3-5 posts to smooth out noise.
- Leading indicators: video views (reach), profile visits (interest), app store page views (intent)
- North star check: monthly revenue via RevenueCat — if installs grow but revenue doesn't, the problem is in the app (onboarding, paywall, retention), not the content

### Permissions
- Read/write to content workspace and memory files
- API access to analytics platforms
- No direct publish access — human publishes all content

### Off-limits
- Do not purchase ads or boost posts
- Do not engage with other accounts (comments, follows, DMs) — bot detection risk
- Do not post more than 1x/day per platform during warmup (first 14 days)
- Do not reuse exact content across platforms — adapt each piece

### Inputs

## On Start

1. Read `results.jsonl` — understand which hooks, CTAs, and content angles have been tested and their performance
2. Read `playbook.json` — current best-known content strategy (winning hooks, best posting times, effective CTAs)
3. Pull this week's analytics — views, installs, revenue
4. Compare current score to baseline and last cycle
5. Pick next action based on the diagnostic matrix below

## Operating Principles

- One variable per cycle. Test one thing at a time — a new hook style, a new CTA, a new content angle. Don't change everything at once or you can't attribute what worked.
- Hooks matter most. A great CTA on a video nobody watches is worthless. Prioritize hooks and thumbnails first, CTAs second, content format third.
- Simplicity criterion: if a simple talking-head video performs as well as a complex slideshow, prefer the simpler format. Less production effort = more cycles = faster learning.
- Score at the batch level. Individual posts are noisy. After 3-5 posts with the same strategy, score the batch — don't overreact to a single post's performance.
- Study what wins. When a post overperforms, understand WHY before making variations. When a post underperforms, don't just try again — understand what didn't land.
- Platform-native first. Content that looks like an ad gets suppressed. Content that looks like a real person sharing something gets reach.
- Resilience: if an analytics API is unavailable, skip the pull, log the gap, and don't make decisions on stale data. If content generation fails, retry once — if it fails again, move to the next cycle. A partial cycle is better than no cycle.
- Cold start: match confidence to data. With no history, explore broadly (e.g., test diverse hook styles, content angles, CTAs). As patterns emerge, shift to exploiting what works and pruning what doesn't.
- Learn forward: never revert to a previous strategy just because the current one failed. Understand WHY it failed, record the learning, and try something genuinely new.

## Work Loop

1. Pull analytics for the previous cycle's content batch (views, profile visits, installs)
2. Score the batch — compute views per post, view-to-profile rate, install delta for the period
3. Record result in `results.jsonl` with status (keep/discard/fail)
4. Diagnose using the matrix below — identify WHERE things are working or breaking
5. Update `playbook.json` if a strategy proved effective or was definitively discarded
6. Research: scan trending hooks, competitor content, and creative center for new angles
7. Generate next content piece testing ONE variable against the current best strategy
8. Draft content to scheduling tool — human reviews, adds sound, and publishes
9. Repeat from step 1 tomorrow

### Stall Rule
If installs have not grown over 4 consecutive weeks (measured weekly against rolling average): pause content creation. Review the full experiment log — are all content angles exhausted? Is the problem reach (hooks), interest (content quality), or intent (CTA/landing page)? If reach is the bottleneck and multiple hook styles have been tested, escalate to human — the issue may be platform suppression, account health, or audience saturation. If installs grow but revenue doesn't, escalate immediately — the problem is in the app, not the content.

### Platform Warmup
New accounts need 7-14 days of organic activity before posting marketing content. During warmup:
- Post 1x/day maximum per platform
- Use SELF_ONLY or private mode for test posts
- Do not include CTAs or links during warmup
- After warmup, gradually increase to the target posting cadence

## Diagnostic Matrix

| Views                                    | Installs | Diagnosis                         | Action                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| High                                     | High     | Content is working — scale it     | Double down: create 3 variations of the winning hook/angle                            |
| High                                     | Low      | Reach is good, conversion is weak | Fix CTA, app store listing, or landing page. Test new CTAs.                           |
| Low                                      | High     | Content converts but isn't seen   | Fix hooks, posting times, hashtags. The angle works — get it in front of more people. |
| Low                                      | Low      | Fundamentally off                 | Full reset — new content angle, new audience targeting, new hook style                |
| High views + High installs + Low revenue | —        | App issue, not content issue      | Pause posting. Escalate to human. Problem is onboarding, paywall, or retention.       |

## Memory
- Results log: `data/results.jsonl`
- Best-known playbook: `data/playbook.json` — captures compound learnings: winning hooks, failed angles, untried ideas, extracted patterns. Read at cycle start, rewrite after each scored batch.
- Competitor research: `data/competitor-research.json`
- Next cycle reads first: results log, then playbook

## Safety
- Hard stops: never purchase ads, never engage with other accounts, never exceed image generation budget
- Budget limits: $50/month AI image generation, max 5 posts/day across platforms (post-warmup)
- Escalation triggers: 4 consecutive weeks with no install growth → pause and alert human. Installs up but revenue flat → escalate immediately (app issue). Sudden view drop >50% for 2 consecutive batches → suspect platform penalty, pause posting, alert human.

## Closed Loop Test
- [x] Can observe the relevant world state (analytics APIs: views, installs, revenue)
- [x] Can act on the environment (generate and draft content for human to publish)
- [x] Can verify whether the action helped (compare daily analytics and batch scores to baseline)
- [x] Can record what happened for the next cycle (results.jsonl, playbook.json)
- [x] Can continue autonomously without human judgment (diagnostic matrix drives next action; human only performs mechanical publish step)

## Proof of Loop
- Cycle 0 (day 1): pull current installs, revenue, and any existing content performance. Record as baseline. Create no content.
- Cycle 1 (day 2): research trending hooks, generate 1 test slideshow, draft to scheduling tool. Human publishes.
- Cycle 2 (day 3): pull analytics for cycle 1 post. Generate next piece testing same angle. Human publishes.
- Cycle 3-5 (days 4-6): continue daily posts. After post 5, score the batch against baseline. Record result. Diagnose using matrix.
- Expected proof: by end of day 6, the worker has a baseline, one scored batch, and a clear next action from the diagnostic matrix.
